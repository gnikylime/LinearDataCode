### Labs

The labs are written in Matlab Live Script and Python / Jupyter.  Other than differences that are forced by the languages themselves, the labs are identical.  There is one lab per chapter (except the more theoretical Chapter 6) in the textbook.

### Coding Demos

The coding demos are written in Matlab and Python.  They are labeled with the book section they are intended to accompany.

### Exercises

Sample homework assignments, one for each book chapter.  There are versions with solutions and without.
